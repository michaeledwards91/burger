Eat Da Burger. Built with Node, Express, MySQL, and Handlebars.

On load you will see a list of all burgers currently in the database. Non-devoured burgers on the left with a 'devour' button next to them, devoured burgers in a list on the right.

To add a burger, type in the name of the burger in the 'burger name' field and click 'add burger'. Once added, it will be shown on the left with the other non-devoured burgers with a 'devour' button next to it.

Clicking 'devour' next to a burger will move that burger to the devoured burgers list.
